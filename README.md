## GIT-HUB 1 Project Overview:

### Summary of Suggested Workflows

These workflows provide **automation for development and deployment processes**:

- **Data-bricks Workflow**: Validates data processing code on push.
- **Azure Functions Workflow**: Tests and deploys functions for data handling and API use.
- **Power BI Workflow**: Checks and validates Power BI templates.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Workflow**: End-to-end testing and deployment on push to `main`.

**This GitHub repository is structured to showcase the integration of Data-bricks, Azure Functions, and Power BI**, providing a comprehensive solution for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The repository is **designed to be easily integrated into an Azure environment** once company access is provided.

## Repository Structure:

- **data-bricks/**: Contains Data-bricks notebooks and related scripts for data processing and analysis.
- **azure_functions/**: Includes Azure Functions code for server-less computing and data manipulation.
- **power_bi/**: Stores Power BI report templates and dataset configurations.
- **docs/**: Comprehensive documentation explaining the project structure, setup, and integration process.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and integration tests for each component.
- **config/**: Configuration files for different environments (Dev, staging, production).

## Key Features:

- **Data-bricks Integration:** Notebooks for data processing, machine learning models, and ETL pipelines.
- **Azure Functions:** Server-less compute for data ingestion, transformation, and API endpoints.
- **Power BI Dashboards:** Pres-configured report templates for data visualization and business intelligence.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment scripts for seamless integration.
- **Documentation:** Detailed guides on local setup, Azure integration, and best practices.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns while maintaining the relationships between Data-bricks, Azure Functions, and Power BI. The repository is designed to be easily understood and integrated into an Azure environment, facilitating a smooth transition when company access is provided.
