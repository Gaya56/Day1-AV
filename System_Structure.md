### **Tool Summary**

1. **Azure Function**: Automates data fetching from the Weather API, preprocesses it, and pushes it to Event Hub for real-time streaming.
2. **Azure Event Hub**: Serves as the central ingestion point for streaming data, enabling real-time data handling for downstream services.
3. **Azure Databricks**: Processes, transforms, and enriches streaming data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold data layers, improving data quality and reliability.
4. **Microsoft Fabric**: Ingests and analyzes real-time data from Databricks via EventStream and KQL Database, supporting complex querying and interactive analytics.
5. **Power BI**: Builds real-time dashboards and visualizations connected to Microsoft Fabric, providing interactive insights into weather patterns and alerts.

This pipeline leverages Azureâ€™s tools for ingestion, processing, analytics, and visualization, creating a robust real-time weather monitoring solution.
