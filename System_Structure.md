                                |
                                | Outputs to Data Lake

                     +-----------------------+
```

### **Key Modifications in the Pipeline**

1. **Azure Function**:
   - Fetches data from the Weather API at regular intervals and sends it directly to **Azure Event Hub**.

2. **Azure Event Hub**:
   - Ingests real-time data from the Azure Function, acting as the primary data streaming hub.

3. **Azure Databricks**:
   - Reads from Event Hub, processes data in real time, and applies transformations.
   - Structures the data into **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers** for optimal data organization.
   - Writes processed data to an **Azure Data Lake Storage** (ADLS) or an Azure Synapse Analytics database.

4. **Azure Synapse Analytics**:
   - Serves as the main analytics and storage layer, housing transformed data from Databricks.
   - Supports **on-demand queries and connections** to Power BI for near-real-time analytics.

5. **Power BI**:
   - Connects directly to Azure Synapse Analytics (or ADLS) with **DirectQuery** or **Push datasets** for real-time dashboarding.
   - Provides up-to-the-minute visualization on weather conditions, metrics, and alerts.

### **How Real-Time is Achieved Without Microsoft Fabric**

- **Real-Time Streaming**: Event Hub enables high-throughput streaming ingestion, so data flows in real time from the API to downstream systems.
- **Databricks Structured Streaming**: Databricks uses Spark Structured Streaming to process data as it arrives, with low latency. This allows for consistent data flow from Event Hub through processing to Synapse.
- **Power BI DirectQuery**: DirectQuery in Power BI on Synapse provides near-real-time refreshes for dashboards, ensuring live updates from the data source.

### **Benefits of This Approach**

- **Scalability**: Each component (Event Hub, Databricks, Synapse, Power BI) is highly scalable, making the architecture resilient to large volumes of data.
- **Flexibility**: Azure Synapse serves as a flexible alternative to Fabric's real-time analytics features, supporting both batch and streaming workloads with SQL-based querying.
- **Cost Efficiency**: This setup reduces reliance on additional services and allows you to leverage the robust data processing capabilities within Databricks and Synapse Analytics.

This approach is capable of meeting real-time requirements while using well-integrated Azure components without Microsoft Fabric.
